			<h1> March 2023 | Create a Portfolio Website </h1>
			<p> 
				The aim of this project was to develop a portfolio website to document and present my self-guided analytics projects. 
				I initially planned to use a content management system such as WordPress or Wix but, having tried them out and researched costs, 
				I instead decided to develop the site from scratch using HTML and CSS. I’m not a web developer but I do have some background in web development 
				through a university module and some self-guided study. While this project isn’t strictly data or behavioural science, 
				I have decided to include it as part of my portfolio because it demonstrates some transferrable skills, 
				and web development knowledge is certainly useful to have in any data role.
				<br>

				Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/eoincotter/PortfolioWebsite" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>.
