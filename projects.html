		    <h1> Self-Guided Projects </h1>
			<p> Each month I undertake an analytics project with the aim of developing my skills and gaining insights into areas of interest to me.
			I aim to do an hour each day, so each of the projects is about 30 hours of work including project planning, software set-up, and learning new concepts.
			As much as possible I try to cover different technologies and areas of analytics. Below you can find a summary of each project and a link to the full project article.
			The code for each project is available on my <a href="https://github.com/eoincotter" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>.

			<summary> May 2023 -- Create a Quantified Self Dashboard -- R (shiny & ggplot2) & SQL </summary>
			<p> In this <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/" target="_blank"> Quantified Self </a> project I created a web app which allows me to input data on my habits, health, 
			and exercise, store the data in a remote database, and present the data over time through two dashboards. 
			I used R shiny to create the data entry form and dashboard interface, Azure SQL Database for data storage, 
			and R ggplot2 for data visualisation. 
			Sample data and code are available on <a href="https://github.com/eoincotter/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/May%202023%20Code.r" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>.

			<summary> April 2023 -- Explore & Clean Data -- SQL </summary>
			<p> In this project I practiced SQL for data cleaning and initial exploration using SQL Server Management Studio. 
			Starting with an untidy dataset, I gained an overview of the table structure; identified column definitions, data types, and constraints; 
			checked for missing and erroneous data; and produced summary statistics such as ranges and measures of central tendency for continuous variables 
			and category counts for categorical variables. 
			I cleaned the dataset by converting dates, splitting text fields, removing duplicates, and recoding categorical variables. 
			Finally, I produced a view containing a subset of records which may be more useful in certain cases such as predictive modelling.
			I used intermediate to advanced SQL concepts such as subqueries, self joins, window functions, common table expressions, and views. 
			Data and code are available on <a href="https://github.com/eoincotter/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/April%202023%20Code.sql" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>.

			<summary> March 2023 -- Create a Portfolio Website -- HTML & CSS </summary>
			<p> The aim of this project was to develop a portfolio website to document and present my self-guided analytics projects. 
			I developed the site from scratch using HTML and CSS. I’m not a web developer but I do have some background in web development through a university module and some self-guided study. 
			While this project isn’t strictly data or behavioural science, I have decided to include it as part of my portfolio because it demonstrates some transferrable skills, 
			and I believe web development knowledge is useful to have in any data role. 
			Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/eoincotter/PortfolioWebsite" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>.
