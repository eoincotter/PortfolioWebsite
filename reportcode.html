			<h1> Eoin Cotter | Data & Behavioural Science </h1>
			<p> Melbourne, VIC </p>
			<p> I hold a Masters in Business Analytics and a Higher Diploma in Psychology. Iâ€™m interested in using a scientific, data-driven approach to understand, predict, and influence the world around me, especially human behaviour. This website documents my efforts to become better at doing so through self-guided projects. </p>
